# Character Encodings (UTF-8, ASCII, ANSI, ...):
# For the computer, letters are just numbers, as we know.
# However, there's different ways of putting numbers on a disk.
# One could use one byte per character, to the effect of having at most 256
# different characters. That is how they used to do up until the mid 2000s.
# Problem: Special characters (e.g. umlaut, asian scripts, ...) do not fit in
# this limited set of characters.
# Another way of putting information on disk would be using multiple bytes per
# character. UTF-16 is a standard that uses 2 Bytes per character and can thus
# use up to 65 536 different characters. While it mitigates one problem, this
# method creates a new one: it wastes a lot of space (most western text only
# uses the first 128 code points).
# Finally, there's UTF-8, which has *variable length encoding*, i.e. the number
# of bytes used per character depends on the character itself. It's a nifty bit
# of technology and I recommend you read into it yourself.
#
# Anyway, in the context of the problem statement:
# The file 'praktische_Physik.txt' uses UTF-8 and umlaut characters. These
# characters take up more space on disk than regular letters, hence the
# difference. A bytes object (as returned from read(binary mode) always counts
# Bytes. The same holds for tell().
# The function len() on the other hand can treat multi-byte characters, if it is
# told so. To that end, we have to explicitly tell Python that the binary data
# read from file are a UTF-8 string. This is done in line 66.
#
# Another way of doing so is by specifying the encoding in the open() command:

print("Alternative counting via len(), encoding in the open command:")
with open("praktische_Physik.txt", "r", encoding='utf-8') as handle :
    text = handle.read()
